# 4d_puzzle
 The game was created by AI
This creates a foundation for a 4D puzzle game with:

4D grid system (x, y, z, w coordinates)
Level structure with start and end positions
Player movement in all 4 dimensions
Basic controls for navigation
Level progression system
To make it more Minecraft-like, you can:

Add textures to the blocks
Implement gravity
Create more complex levels with different block types
Add inventory system
Include building mechanics
To run the game:

npm run dev

The game shows a 3D projection of the current w-slice (like a cross-section of the 4D space). Players can move in all four dimensions using the controls, trying to reach the end position while avoiding obstacles.

Next steps would be:

Add block textures
Implement collision detection
Create more complex level designs
Add particle effects for dimension transitions
Include power-ups and special blocks
Add a level editor
